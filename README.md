## ECE 20007 Electrical Engineering Fundamentals I Lab
### Course Description
This is an introduction course in electronic measurement and circuit modeling, simulation and design techniques. These skills are developed through a variety of laboratory experiments ranging from voltage, current, and frequency, to resistors, inductors, capacitors, and operational amplifiers. When possible, the experiments develop practical skills through small design and soldering tasks. Finally, the course culminates in a two week group design project.  In many ways this course is the laboratory of the co-requisite lecture course ECE 20001: Electrical Engineering Fundamentals I; however, we remind students that this is a standalone course that expects students will learn and demonstrate material not taught in ECE 20001.
